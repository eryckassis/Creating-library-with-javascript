# Creating Library with JavaScript

> This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of learning about JavaScript libraries in the Node.js environment. Here, I document hands-on experiences using, exploring, and creating my own JavaScript library for Node.js.

---

## 📋 About This Project

This project serves as a technical journal and laboratory for experimenting with core concepts of JavaScript libraries, especially within the Node.js ecosystem. The main goal is to deepen understanding of how to consume, analyze, and build modular, reusable, and efficient libraries.

### Key Topics Covered

- Structure and organization of a JavaScript library
- Design patterns used in modern libraries
- Modularization and exporting functionalities (CommonJS vs. ES Modules)
- Best practices for publishing packages to NPM
- Testing, documentation, and versioning of libraries
- Automation with scripts and continuous integration
- Practical usage examples of the created library
